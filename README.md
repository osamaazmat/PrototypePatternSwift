# PrototypePatternSwift


 This is an example implementation of Prototype Design Pattern
 
 Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern which is
 used when creating new Objects. It reduces the expense of creating
 Objects which have multiple dependencies.
 
 It uses an already created instance and by copying its recourses
 or by copying its values, it creates a clone which can then be
 used as required.
